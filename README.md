The Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Laboratory of the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Chile (BBM UChile) has a history of more than 50 years, being one of the first biochemistry laboratories to be founded in the country. Since its beginnings, it has developed research related to protein biophysics and enzymology, being at the forefront of these areas in Chile. Much of the research has as background the molecular evolution of protein families, which requires a multidisciplinary approach where structural bioinformatics plays a fundamental role.
